# Family-tree-problem
Scripts to help find the logical limits of family trees

Arriving at this project was inspired by the House of Habsburg (look up their family tree) and a mental challenge Scott and I arrived at on holiday. We tried to work out whether it was possible for your brother to alos be your uncle, or mother to also be your grandmother. Expanding the problems to to three relationships was beyond our mental capacity, but made for a nice programming challenge.
